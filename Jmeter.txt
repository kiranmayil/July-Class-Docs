
Jmeter -
100% java based based performance testing tool
Performance testing - checks the perforANCE OF THE SYSTEM/application under load
responsives, speed, scalibility, stability

100/1000 - 

Tools for load testing:
jmeter, load runner, silk performer...

jmeter - open source, UI, integtrate with other tools like jenkins

Types of performance testing:

load testing - testing the appalication under load(concurrent users)
stress testing - to know the applications break point 
volume testing - testing on database
endurance testing - testing the application for high load over a period 
	of time(24 - 48 hrs)
	
User point of view - how fast my application is responding
Business point view(dev, owner, tester) - how many users i am gng to serve, 
how fast iam to serve
system hardware configurations - CPU, memory, n/w, bandwidth, server, OS

How it works :
tool,choose the target server, business flows that are to be testing, 
simulate no of users/thread(100), listeners(to collect the test results), Assertions,
pre processors n post processpors, 

Thread - user

Ramp up  - taken taken to start all the threads
10 threads - rampup time - 10sec

Points to see in the response/output:
Throughput - no of request processing per sec
load time - time taken to load the page
connect time - time taken to connect to the server
latency - time taken to get the first byte of response/output
sample error% - total number of errors occured
size - bytes/sent bytes

Data driven testing on Jmeter
1) user defined variables - instead of hardcoding  in the script, we pass the data 
using user defined variables.
2) CSV file - includonh external CSV passing the data to the script
3) JDBC connections - 
Jdbc connection configuration
jdbc request - selcect statememnts
ojdbc jar - put that in jmeter lib folder
