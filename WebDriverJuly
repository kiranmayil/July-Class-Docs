PageObject pattern:
Every page in UI application will have a corresponding Java Page Class and Test Class.
Main advantage of PageObject pattern is clear separation of testcases which helps for easy maintenance.
Also it avoids code redundancy.

Page classes - have the logic to identify the WebElement and return back the actual value/elements needed for assertions.
TestClasses -  assertions 


HomePage- test navigations manu, header links, search box,click signin, register....
SearchResultsPage- test the no of results, valid reslts, sort features(by rating, price), filters...
SearchDetailsPage-
AddToCartPage


HomePageTest
SearchResultsPageTest
SearchDetailsPageTest

WebDriver: API
tool used to automate web applications

get
findElement
findElements
getTitle
close - close the current instance of the browser 
quit - closes all the browser instances
windowhandle
windowhandles

WebElement:

click- we can click on link or button
sendKeys- to send/input text into the text boxes
getText()- to get inner text of an element
getAttribute
isDisplayed() - boolean value - used on any webElemnt
isEnabled() - boolean value - used on any webElemnt
isSelected() - boolean value - used on radiobuttons, checkboxes, //dropdown

DropDowns:
Select
selectByIndex
selectByVisibleText
selectByValue

**********************

findElement - it locates one elemnt on the page, it returns WebElement, 
looking for element - it i snot present on the html page - NoSuchElementFound Exeception

findElements - it locates list if elemnets on  the page, it returns List<WebElements>
looking for element - it i snot present on the html page - it returns empty list

<h1 class="heading heading-d" data-reactid=".0.0.1.0.1.2">Sign in to your account</h1>
tagname - h1
attributes - key, value pair - class, data-reactid
innertext - Sign in to your account


By class methods:

id - attribute, 
name - attribute
classname - attribute
tagname - h1,input, form, p, a, div...
linktext - entire link text on the webpage
partiallinktext - partial link text
xpath - path, location on the page, absolute n relative xpath
xpath disadvantages:
1) hard to understand, write
2) it will not always work with IE
1) backward and forward in using the path
<div>
<div>

Thread.sleep(3000);// by default pause program execution
it is from java, it is going to stop the execution for the specified time what ever might  
be the case

element is loaded immediately
its taking time to load the element 


Waits:

ImplicitWait: implicit wait waits for any of the element that takes time to load in webpage/poll the DOM.
default is 0 seconds.
it will wait untill the time specified in the wait and if the elemnt is not found it is 
going to throw an exception.
In implicit wait it is going to check for the element first then wait for the entire time what we are specifing in the
implicit wait. it is on driver and it applicable to all the elements that are open with the driver.
for entire page

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlWait(20, TimeUnit.SEONDS);

It wil initially check if the element is present , if its found then it will not wait for given wait time 20secoonds
if it is not found 0 then it waits for complete wait time(eg:20seconds) even though element is avaialble within 10 or 15 seconds.

Meaning which it checks first at 0th sec and after 20 seconds- not in between


ExplicitWait:
It waits for a specific element or condition
		
		WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,30);
		element =wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector(".prime-button-try>a")));
		element.click();
		
It wil initially check if the element is present , if its found then it will not wait for given wait time(20secoonds)

if it is not found at 0th sec then it starts waiting for given waittime
but it keeps checking in between by default for every 500ms if element is found- if it is found then it will not wait for entire time
20seconds
0th
500ms
.....
10th sec or 15th sec - 
Syntax:
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,20);
List<WebElement> ddValues = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfAllElementsLocatedBy(By.cssSelector(".typeahead-row-link")));


Fluent Wait: 
is s type of explicit wait where we have option o override the polling/frequency time
and we have other option like ignoringException...

both explicit wait and fluent wait have method - wait.until- which accepts
ExpectedConditions, Function and Predicate.
Predicate(I) has apply method where output is always boolean and any input type
but in function(I) you can have your own output and input types in method.
Syntax:
WebDriverWait wait = new FluentWait(driver).
							.pollingEvery(10,TimeUnit.Seconds)
							.withTimeOut(20,TimeUnit.SECONDS)
							.ignoring(NoSuchElementFound);
List<WebElement> ddValues = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfAllElementsLocatedBy(By.cssSelector(".typeahead-row-link")));


When to go for which wait:
Implicit wait - when there are lot of webelments operations, and you dont know which elech elemnt is taking time
in that case we will go for Implicit wait

Explicit wait - suppose you are working on a element, and you want to be sure that because of network, 
you dont want ur TS to be failed
it only works on single condition or series of steps u can include add to explicit wait condition by using 

Actions:is a class, users mouse realted actions Actions class have some predefined methods.
hover, click, contextclick, doubleclick, keypress, keyrelease, dragndropby, moveToElement
mouse hover
moveTo
perform
right click
drag and drop

perform  - to perform one single on the element
action.moveToElement("element").perform();
build - to perform more than one action then we first build and then perform.
action.moveToElement("element").click().build().perform();


navigate:

css selector: different ways to write css csselectors

[id='idValue'] or #idvalue
[class='classValue'] or .classValue
[name='nameValue']
[attributeName='attributeValue']

#fblogin>button - direct child
#fblogin i - any child

#bUYZ-origin
#c_86m-origin

[id^='a71V']- starts-with
[id$='a71V']- end-with
[id*='a71V']- contains


[attributename^='attributevalue']- starts-with

[attributename$='attributevalue']]- end-with

[attributename*='attributevalue']- contains

.pull-right.social-icons li:nth-child(3)

.pull-right.social-icons li:nth-of-type(3)


sibling -- +
.logo.col-md-4.col-sm-4+div

https://saucelabs.com/resources/articles/selenium-tips-css-selectors


xpath:
absolute xpath: traverse from the root of the html document all the way to the element,
It is lengthy.
It is not preferred bcz it is complex and if any new elements ar added or deleted in betweenwe need to
again modify our locator.

/html/body/header/div/div/button....

/html/body/header/div[2]/div/ul/li[1]/a/button

relative xpath: Directly identify the element by using its attribute values.
It is shorter than absolute xpath

//*[@attrname='attrvalue']

//*[@id='headerfblogin']

//*[starts-with(@id,'header')]
//*[contains(@id,'header')]

//*[contains(text(),'hear')] - to identify element using inner text of the element

//*[starts-with(@attrbutename,'attrvalue')]

//div[@id='navbar-collapse']/ul/li[3]

.//*[@class='hidden-xs top-bar']/following::div[1]
.//*[@class='header-main container']/preceding::div[2]

//*[@class='logo col-md-4 col-sm-4']/following-sibling::div
//*[@class='logo col-md-4 col-sm-4']/preceding-sibling::div

xpath- xpath is complex to write 
we can traverse forward and also backward in a dom using xpath
we can isentify the lement using its inner text als0 if required by using text()
which we cannot do in css selectors

css selectors- is simple, easier, faster and more cross browser compatable.
we can traverse only forward in a dom using css selector
****************************************
FileUpload- 

windows based interactions as part of web application
selenium cannot handle desktop based interactions.
 
we can handle desktop based interactions using
1. Autoit 
2. Robot class(java.awt)

https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/

download autoit

part1: script to handle desltop file upload interactions
to learn about autoit framework methods use-  C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\AutoIt help file
open C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\Au3Info_x64 - which is finder tool(like firepath)
open C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\SciTE\sciTE- text editor- type the code and save as autoit file,
then compile to generate .exe
 
part2: embed the script with web application using selenium
Once .exe is ready - we wil use this in selenium automation script

table:

//*[@id='mytable']/tbody/tr/td[2]

#mytable>tbody>tr:nth-of-type(2)


Alerts 4 types:

1. java script alerts
cannot right click-- 
These type of alerts can be handled by Alert class in selenium

window.alert
window.prompt
window.confirm


2. Modal popups / html popups
driver.get("http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/")

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector([title='close']))).click();

send keys


3. Desktop/window based popups
Handle using Robot or AutoIt
but best is robot


4. browser notifications
we can handle using DesiredCapabilities
ChromeOptions
FirefoxProfile



Desired capabilties- 
Settings needed for selenium grid where we want to specify RemoteWebDriver class about
browser name, version and OS (platform name) details.

Mobile AUtomation- appium- we use desired capabilties to give platform, device and app details

Also we can handle browser specific settings like handling notifications, clean session, enable javascript etc

Firefox and chrome have spefic classess again on top of DesiredCapabilities as below:
ChromeOptions
FirefoxProfile

******************************************

Automation Framework:

It is created to reuse the code(avoid redundancy) and application is easy to maintain.
PageObject, KeyWord driven, Data Driven, Modular , etc...

PageObject , Datadriven - Hybrid pattern (combination of one or more patterns)

10 screens/pages in your UI application

20 java classes-
10 page  classes
10 test classes

PageObject: It is a design pattern which we use in test automation which helps
test maintenance and reduces code duplication.
Page Classes have the methods created to perfom selenium actions on the element
Test Classes will call the Page class methods , get the actual data and assert with expected data.

advantages:

Clean separation between test code and page code
Single repository for all testcases of respective page which makes modifications(add or delete functionalty in page)
easier as testcases are not scattered randomly in java classes.

DataDriven:
Execute same script with different sets of data,
We store all the test data in external file (excel/csv) and tests are driven with data using these external files

Explain about automation framework:

we created  automation fw to reuse the code(avoid redundancy) and application is easy to maintain.
we used PageObject and Data Driven combination in our project.
Based on any programing language(Java),
We create PageClasses using SeleniumWebDriver, test classes using any unit test framework(TestNG)
we create some base/parent classes to handle common code.
We inject the driver object that is need in all page classes using a common mechanism(depenedency injection)
we can create webdriver object easier way by using Java Factory design pattern.
We create some utilities/helper classes which  will be static methods(Java) to deal with common/reusable functionalties.
eg: WebDriverUtil, ExcelReader, TakeScreenShot,  PropertiesFileReader etc....
We use TestNG for assertions, testcase managment using testng xml files where we can combine different testcases
as test suites.We can group testcases, we can handle dependent testcases(one test execution is depenedent on other),
we can prioritize test cases, we can make use of inbuilt html/xml reports from TestNG,(we can also customize
the reports using Ireporter,ITestListener- listener, we can customize logs using apache log4j and TestNG-TestListeneradapter.
)
we have resources folder where we maintain all the non java files- excel/properties/ driver executbles...
we used maven for dependency and build managment(we execute tests by using maven cmds like mvn test, mvn clean install)
(for this we integarte maven and testng together using maven surefire plugin config in pom.xml)

we are also using git as code repository and jenkins for CI and CD.
