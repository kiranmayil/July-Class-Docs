Sprint 1 - 100Tc
sprint2 - 100tc + 100tc

login scenario - 20sets

Advantages of Automation:
human tendency to miss something - automation 
test coverage is good 
fast 
regression testing
data driven testing

limitations of automation testing/ when we cant go for automation
shorter time limits - 
look and feel - UI testing - video n audio quality - 
catcpha images, otp generations, barcodes
dev - 
in the test environment we can make it constant
call to captca service
java code
web/browser applications - 
UI/elements(textbox, buttons, dropdown) of the page is frequently change
 login - 
 manually - open, enter un , pwd, click ok, 
 automation - opens the browser, find the textbox to enter un, pwd, button, 
 asserting for nxt steps
 
Tools available to auomate:


http://www.seleniumhq.org/ - official website for selenium

What is selenium -
selenium webdriver(API) is a tool used to automate webapplication
Webdriver - it is an interface from selenium webdriver api, 
which is used to autmate web applications

WebElements - 

Components:
IDE, RC, Grid, Webdriver

IDE - plugin for firefox, record and playback tool,assert statments

testcase:
testcase
executeit - result
assert(actual,expected) - passed/failed
actual - result
expected - specification doc

assert/ verify:
assert(act,exp) - true - passed - it continues with the execution
				  false - failed - it comes out of the method, it is not 
				  gng to continue with the rest of the steps in the same methods.
verify(act,exp) - true - passed - it continues with the execution
				  false - logs the erroe and contiues the next steps in the 
				  same method.

Limitations of IDE:
Record options - limited options, cannot enchance the code according to the requirement
only works for firefox
we cannot integrate with other tools

RC: - remote control
code based,


WebDriver:
Fast, integrate with other tools, supports different languages

To setup the environment:
1) IDE - Eclipse, IntelliJ
2) Selenium jars - maven, testng, drivers, selenium jars
3) setup the automation framework
	1) selenium webdriver
	2) Testng(testing framework)
	3) java
	4) maven(build tool)
	5) git - source repository
	6) jenkins - integration tool
4) create automation scripts
